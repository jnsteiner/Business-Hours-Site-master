		<h2>Find Business Hours Near You TESTTESTTEST</h2>
		<br />
		<p>Wouldn’t it be great if every store you ever went to was always open 24 hours?  This would save all of us from having to rush to the doors of our local market before they lock up, or it could save us from driving to a store that’s already closed for the evening. Unfortunately, this utopia doesn’t exist and we’re left with some stores opened with limited hours during holidays, some closed on Mondays, while some close early on weekends, and hours always change during the Thanksgiving-Christmas rush - It’s memory overload!  To alleviate the processing power and memory you have to use to remember such trivial things - Business Hours is here to help!</p>

<p>Business Hours is a website developed by a pair of ambitious graduate students who wanted to make life easier for everyone.  The website provides a powerful, simplistic search feature that will allow anonymous visitors and registered users alike to search for the hours of operation for local businesses. It’s as simple as that. </p>
